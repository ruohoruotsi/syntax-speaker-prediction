# Syntax Speaker Prediction

This repository contains notebooks used to train a model to predict the speaker (Scott or Wes) in one second cilps of their podcast, syntax.fm. There are accompanying files for using Prodigy to label the data required to build the model. There is a brief description of the purpose of each notebook as the first cell.


## The Results

**Total Podcast Time**: 3 days, 15 hours, 56 minutes, 39 seconds

**Wes**: 2 days, 1 hours, 51 minutes, 11 seconds

**Scott**: 1 days, 11 hours, 51 minutes, 45 seconds

**Non-speaking time (crosstalk, laughing, intros)**: 0 days, 2 hours, 13 minutes, 43 seconds
